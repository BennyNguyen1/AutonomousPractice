9/20 - Autonomous Practice Problem #1:
The mechanical team completed constructing a drivetrain. The drivetrain comprises two HD Hex Motors on each side, with two gearboxes added. The gearboxes are 5:1 and 4:1 on each motor. The motor names, as labeled in the driver's hub, are "leftMotor1," "leftMotor2", "rightMotor1", and "rightMotor2." The wheels of the drivetrain have a diameter of 60mm, and you must move the robot 740mm forward.
Note: I have the answer key published, but don't look at it! This is meant to be practice, and you'll only end up boring yourself because I didn't teach you how to solve the second problem yet.

9/20-9/22 - Autonomous Practice Problem #2:
The mechanical team finished another drivetrain. This time, the drivetrain is a six wheel drive, titled "left1", "left2", "left3", "right1", "right2", and "right3" in the driver's hub. Lucky for you, they didn't change the gear ratios from the other day. There are often tape markings on the field, and you'll be utilizing them today. Have the robot run 200mm forward. Then, red tape will be marked on the robot's path. After running 200mm, make the robot continue driving until the red tape ends.
