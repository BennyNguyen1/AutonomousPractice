9/15 - Autonomous Practice Problem:
The mechanical team completed constructing a drivetrain. The drivetrain comprises two HD Hex Motors on each side, with two gearboxes added. The gearboxes are 5:1 and 4:1 on each motor. The motor names, as labeled in the driver's hub, are "leftMotor" and "rightMotor." The wheels of the drivetrain have a diameter of 60mm, and you must move the robot exactly 740mm forward.
